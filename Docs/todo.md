# TODO

Not implemented game states/phases:

- [ ] TradeInSetsHoldingAtLeastThreeCards
- [x] DraftArmies
- [x] Attack
- [x] SendArmiesToOccupy
- [ ] TradeInSetsHoldingFiveOrMoreCards
- [x] Fortify
- [x] GameOver

Issues:

- [ ] Show current player's cards, and enable trade-in set of cards
- [ ] Eliminated player should not take turn

Improvements:

- [ ] When attacking and not occupying, do not deselect territory
- [ ] After attacking and winning, auto-select (new) conquered territory
- [ ] Select number of armies to move in after attack or when fortifying
- [ ] Show continent information on board?
- [ ] Give user hints or help messages. E.g. A selected territory with only one army can't attack any territory.
- [ ] Create Neutral AI player
- [ ] Add Nuclear custom rules...What!?
