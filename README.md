# flaming-strike

Clone of a famous strategic game. Details and history about the original game can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game).

The game is based on the standard rules, but the intent is to add some homebrew/custom rules. We'll see... :)

The game engine is built upon .NET standard. Front end in WPF and using Caliburn.Micro

Enjoy!
